text = "       There once were 3 hideous monsters and scoundrels who lived alone in a brick house in the forest. They were shunned by society and forced to live in solitude. Or they self exiled themselves due to their deformities. Im not sure, I didn’t feel comfortable asking. My first morning here, i went out to read and heard the birds chirping, it’s honestly quite pleasant. The environment is peaceful and there’s good food. I apologize for being negative at first. Well, anyway, they lived here, in the brick house, you know playing and doing things to pass the time. Then suddenly like by the will of a mighty malevolent God, the brick house and the monsters were transported to the gates of a deep hell. Like flames, lava, spikey rocks; the whole works. Then, the God spoke to them, telling them that they were now his puppets and only once they bested his legions of demons in combat, will he reward them with their freedom. The residents of the brick house  took up the challenge, with a blood thirsty grin. It’s in the nature of ugly creatures to be evil. I would have asked specifically why the evil God did what he did, but again I didn’t feel comfortable asking. Well, thats about it. Only time will tell if the hideous monsters and scoundrels will prevail against this great evil. "
